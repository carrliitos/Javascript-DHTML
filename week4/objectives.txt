Activity 1 - 3

Study the two documents on 'Objects' in the 'Introduction to JavaScript' module to understand how to define and use objects in JavaScript.

The 'Creating Many Objects' document shows how to manipulate an array of objects. Study the example and understand how to use an array of objects. The output is sent to the console. Hence, you will have to  save the code as an HTML file with .html extension, open it using any web browser, and then view the developer console to check the output.

You should be familiar with the developer console as it is the best place to check for syntax error.

Complete Assignment 8. The output can be sent to the console, as in the 'Creating Many Objects' document. In the next, activity, you will use the browser to  display the output.
