Use the courses array of objects defined below to display a list of courses available for next semester.
Add a filter mechanism to filter courses based on the following categories:
- Core courses
- Elective courses
- Unique courses
- 300 or above courses

## TODO:
- [x] Use a table to display courses list
- [x] Add a link/checkbox/button to each courses to select/plan for next semester
- [x] Use a table to display selected/planned courses (similar to a shopping cart).
	- [x] Add a button/link to remove courses from the cart.
- [x] Display total credits selected/planned for the next semester.
- [x] Display an appropriate message if the shopping cart is empty.
- [x] Display error messages if the selected course is already in the shopping cart.

The JSON courses are located [here](https://github.com/carrliitos/Javascript-DHTML/blob/master/FinalProject/index.js#L1)
